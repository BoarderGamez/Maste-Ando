## Remote Commands (Socket Server)

Server listens on `127.0.0.1:65432` for these commands:

| Command                 | Description                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `get_faces`             | Returns all face IDs and their emojis |
| `set_face <num>`        | Sets face by number             |
| `set_custom_face <face>`| Sets a custom face string       |
| `set_scale <value>`     | Adjust the scale dynamically    |

---

## Notes

- Active window detection works best on **Windows**; other OSes fallback with limited functionality.  
- The window is transparent with rounded corners for style.  
- The faces and moods can be customized inside the `faces_dict` in the code.
